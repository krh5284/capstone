#This project is a forest fire prediction model based on data published by P. Cortez and A. Morais in _A Data Mining Approach to Predict Forest Fires Using Meteorological Data_. This project was completed as a part of a capstone project for the Northwest Missouri State University Master of Science in Data Analytics. 

#The current model is based upon the data published at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitm004/forest-fire-area and the report can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/read/ywfyfsvwdgkh#ddbd65

#The model accounts for variables such as location, month, date, temperature, relative humidity, fine fuel moisture code, duff moisture code, drought code, and initial spread index as defined in the Fire Weather Index (https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms437/cffdrs/fire-weather-index-system). The intent is to eventually improve the model to be able to account for data related to fire history at a given location.
